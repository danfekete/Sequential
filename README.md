# Sequential

This library is the successor of the SeqDB engine. The whole purpose of this library is to enable the generation of truly sequential IDs into buckets even when running parallel.

There are times when you need to make sure that when sequentially generating the IDs there are no gaps or repetitions.

## Installation
